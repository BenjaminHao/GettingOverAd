GettingOverAd.A very challenging jumping game. One of the game goals is to clean the "ADS virus"(actually, the virus is just ending game ads and banner ads which is at the bottom of screen). Kill monsters to get anti-infectives. Gathering 100 anti-infectives (not sure yet)from each 3 different monsters to get the final antibody, and then ads would all disappear. Another goal, ofc, is to get a higher score.

This is just the demo version, no ads at all. It's better playing on real devices since I put too much stuff in update() method. I believe it's gna be released at App Store soon.

Hold screen to charge. Move finger to change jumping direction. Release finger to jump. You are able to kill monsters when you are in falling status(not higher than monsters). 

No collision with platforms when jumping. Short platforms won't spawn monsters. Medium platforms will fall after 4s when you touch it(even not landing on it). Be careful of inertia when landing on the platforms, you can short click the opposite direction to handle it.

Landing on a platform +1, killing monsters +2. When you reach 80% of the tower, you will enter fever time. Fever time will add 1 bonus score.
